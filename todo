Working on:


Ideas:




Need to Do:
	--Restart the server
	-- When clicking on online list charater doesn't bring over level to the list.
	--If at any point a connection is lost or server is shutdown need to log out back to front page 
			**This can be done i think by Setup context in Mangostelnet and every command check if active
	--Remove the square boxes
	--Use SOAP server
